# CodeChallenge
All 3 tareas included (1. "google" is the task with the first non-repeating character in a string. Thought it would be cool if User can type in the String. 2.  "Median" is the task for where we should be able to add Int and calculate the median. 3. "List" is the last and biggest task
not sure about the time stamp, never did that before, may need some help with that
